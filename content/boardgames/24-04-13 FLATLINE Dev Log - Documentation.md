# The Rules
We initially documented our designs in Excalidraw file and push them to a git repo for version management, but as time goes, the complexity starts to increase. 

→ So we documented the rules into a gitbook page: [**FLATLINE Rulebook**](https://bhodgheymesdocumentation.gitbook.io/docs)

The game turned out the be kind of like a table-top tactical shooter. The rules are pretty complex for a simple boardgame. And we dediced that the game will be **BRUTAL**, meaning the enemies are **DEADLY**, and misplays can lead the a mission fail.

I'll summarize the rules here
* 4 players play together to complete a campaign: a serie of 3 missions.
* Before each mission, the players are given a budget to buy gears
  * Enter [**the Armory**](https://bhodgheymesdocumentation.gitbook.io/docs/readme/preparation-phase#the-armory)
* The players hears the mission briefing and plan their moves
* Mission start
  * Each turn consists of 3 phases: Event, Player's, Enemy's
    * Event Phase: count mission timer, roll random events, etc
    * Players Phase: Each player gets 3 action points which they can choose to do stuff however they like such as:
      * Move 1AP
      * Move (Sprint) 2AP
      * Attack 1AP
      * Use Gadget 1AP
      * Scout Rooms 1AP
      * etc.
    * Enemy Phase: The players moves the enemies according to their rules, there are 4 types of enemies:
      * Underling: basic grunt unit that shoots at you
      * Sprinter: charges at you and deal powerful melee damage
      * Ghosteye: sniper unit that shoots from afar
      * Titan: tough unit that is slow but can tank many shots

# Making of assets
It came to a point where we can no longer decide what is the best for the game without actually playing it. So we start to make assets to prepare for the first playtest.
